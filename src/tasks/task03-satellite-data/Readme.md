# Satellite Data

This task is to extract the data for analyzing and working on modelling processing. We had used Sentinel-2A, Sentinel 3 and Landsat 8 Satellite Imagery.

## satellite Imagery

### Sentinel - 2A

Sentinel-2 is an Earth observation mission from the Copernicus Programme that comprises a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites and systematically acquires optical imagery at high spatial resolution over land and coastal waters. 

### Sentinel 3

Sentinel-3 is an Earth observation satellite series developed by the European Space Agency as part of the Copernicus Programme. It currently consists of 2 satellites: Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B. 

The main objective of the Sentinel-3 mission is to measure sea surface topography, sea and land surface temperature, and ocean and land surface colour with high accuracy and reliability to support ocean forecasting systems, environmental monitoring and climate monitoring.

### Landsat 8

The Landsat 8, an orbiting satellite whose purpose it is to map the earth and track changes as seen from space.
