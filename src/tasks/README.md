# Task Folder Details

Note : Please Follow the below guidelines to create task folders
- Task Folder Naming Convention : _task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)_  ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
- All Task folder names should be in chronologial order (from 1 to n)
- All Task folders should have a README.md file with task Details and task goals along with an info table containing all code/notebook files with their links and information
- Task folders that contain sub-tasks can create sub folders within the task.
- __Update the below table explaining the task details.__

### Task Table

| Task No| Task Name | Details |
|-|-|-|
|1| task-1-water-quality-standards |All the water quality parameters have been listed in this task which includes Inorganic parameters, Organic parameters, Parameters relating to acceptability, taste, odour and appearance, Radiological parameters and Microbiological parameters and their standard limits.       |
|2| task-2-literature-review       |Research papers were reviewed here and important points were noted for different remote sensing data used with machine learning and different satellite sources were revised properly.          |
|3| task-3-satellite-data       |Various Data sources were searched in Google Earth Engine and relevant sources were selected for our use-case.         |
|4| task-4-satellite-image-analysis       |Analysed the images from the selected sources and applied various standard formulae were applied to analyse the colours of the water body regions.         |
|5| task-5-water-quality-parameters-identify       |Final water quality parameters were selected and their names listed along with their band formulae.         |
|6| task-6-machine-learning       |Various Machine learning models were applied on the final dataframe and the metrics were analysed and the best model was chosen with having a good validation accuracy.         |
|7| task-7-dashboard       |A visualisation dashboard is created for the public to enter coordinates, their region of interest(water-body) and the data range to get the water quality for that area along with data visualisation display for the collected from the satellite.         |
|8|Political Rationale| The entire basis of the political rationale is to create a document upon which we could use as a basis to know if the direction of our current application is viable or not|
