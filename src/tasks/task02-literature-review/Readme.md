### Summary 

Kutch district is district of Gujarat state in western India. As people knows about conditions of Arid and Semi-arid regions like Water Scarcity, Less Fertility of Land, Erosion,Less Rainfall etc. Kutch is also passing through same condition from decades as major part of district is covered by desert.
Kutch has variable climate over years with high temperature and less rainfall. Kutch has an average eleva-tion of 110 meters’ (360 feet).
